"""
TC ->O(log N)
SC ->O(1)

Logic:
Compute the mid-index and check if the element at mid greater than the value mid+1.
If yes, we can ignore the right side and move to left half.
If no, move to the right half.
Eventually the l and h pointers will cross and the value we need is l+1
The logic is based on the fact that the input array contain values from 1 to n-1 and no duplicates
